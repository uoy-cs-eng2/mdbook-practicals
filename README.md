# ENG2 practicals

This repository hosts the [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) sources of the worksheets for the practicals of the ENG2 module at the University of York.

To build this book locally, install mdBook using the [official instructions](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html).
You can then serve it locally with:

```shell
mdbook serve --open
```

Alternatively, you can build a static HTML version in the `book` folder with:

```shell
mdbook build
```
