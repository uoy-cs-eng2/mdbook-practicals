# Practicals

These are the worksheets for the practicals of the "Engineering 2: Automated Software Engineering" module at the University of York.

The practicals are divided into two parts:

* [Part 1](./practicals/part1.md) covers data-intensive systems with the [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) framework.
* [Part 2](./practicals/part2.md) covers model-driven engineering within the Eclipse modelling ecosystem ([EMF](https://eclipse.dev/emf/), [Epsilon](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/), and [Sirius](https://eclipse.dev/sirius/)).
