# Practical 3: Integrating external services

This is the worksheet for the fourth practical in the Engineering 2 module.

We will start from a solution to Practical 2, and integrate an external service to fetch more information about the books.
You will practice with using the Gateway pattern to encapsulate the details of accessing this external service.

Work through every section of the practical in sequence, without missing steps. You can use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons on the left and right sides to quickly go between sections.
