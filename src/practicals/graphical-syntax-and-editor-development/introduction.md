# Introduction

In this practical you will create a graphical syntax for one of the languages from Practical 6 on paper, and you will then implement a graphical editor for it using [Eclipse Sirius](https://eclipse.dev/sirius).

## What you should already know

- You must be familiar with defining domain-specific metamodels using Emfatic.
- You must have attended or watched the graphical modelling / Sirius lectures.

## What you will learn

- How to define graphical syntaxes and editors using Sirius.
- How to use graphical Sirius editors to create and edit models.

## What you will need

- An Eclipse installation with EMF, Epsilon and Sirius (see the [Tools](../modelling-and-metamodelling/tools.md) section of Practical 6).
