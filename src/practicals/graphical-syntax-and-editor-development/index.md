# Practical 7: Graphical syntax and editor development

This is the worksheet for the seventh practical in the Engineering 2 module.

In this practical you will create a graphical syntax for one of the languages from Practical 6 on paper, and you will then implement a graphical editor for it using Eclipse Sirius.

Work through every section of the practical in sequence, without missing steps. You can use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons on the left and right sides to quickly go between sections.
