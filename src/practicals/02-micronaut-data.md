# Practical 2: ORM with Micronaut Data

This is the worksheet for the second practical in the Engineering 2 module.
Starting from a solution of Practical 1 (whether your own, or the model solution), you will change it to use a relational database via [Micronaut Data](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide).

Work through every section of the practical in sequence, without missing steps.
You can use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons on the left and right sides to quickly go between sections.
