# Practical 3: Reacting to events

This is the worksheet for the third practical in the Engineering 2 module.

We will give you the code for a simulator of the check-in desks in an airport,
and you will create an additional Micronaut project that will consume its events
through [Micronaut Kafka](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-kafka/latest/guide/) to produce a number of reports about the current state of the airport.

Work through every section of the practical in sequence, without missing steps. You can use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons on the left and right sides to quickly go between sections.
