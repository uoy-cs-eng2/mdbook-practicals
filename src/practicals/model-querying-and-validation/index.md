# Practical 8: Model querying and validation

This is the worksheet for the eight practical in the Engineering 2 module.

In the sixth practical, you developed three metamodels and constructed models that conform to them. In this practical you will write model management programs and run them against models to query and validate them.

Work through every section of the practical in sequence, without missing steps. You can use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons on the left and right sides to quickly go between sections.
