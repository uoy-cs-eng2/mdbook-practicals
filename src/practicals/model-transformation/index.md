# Practical 9: Model transformation

This is the worksheet for the ninth practical in the Engineering 2 module.

This practical covers model-to-text (M2T) transformation using [EGL](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/egl)/[EGX](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/egx) and model-to-model (M2M) transformation using [ETL](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/etl).

Work through every section of the practical in sequence, without missing steps. You can use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons on the left and right sides to quickly go between sections.
