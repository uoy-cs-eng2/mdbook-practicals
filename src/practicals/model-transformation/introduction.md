# Introduction

In this practical you will use the [Epsilon Generation Language (EGL)](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/egl) for model-to-text transformation and the [Epsilon Transformation Language (ETL)](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/etl) for model-to-model transformation. Both EGL and ETL extend the syntax of EOL so it is important that you have attempted the EOL exercises in Practical 8.

## What you should already know

- How to use Sirius-based editors to create and edit models.
- How to use EOL to query models.

## What you will learn

- How to write and run model-to-text transformations with EGL on EMF-based models.
- How to write and run model-to-model transformations with ETL on EMF-based models.

## What you will need

- An Eclipse installation with EMF and Epsilon (see the [Tools](../modelling-and-metamodelling/tools.md) section of Practical 6).
