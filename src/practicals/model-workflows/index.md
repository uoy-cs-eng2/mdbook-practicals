# Practical 10: Model workflows

This is the worksheet for the tenth practical in the Engineering 2 module.

This practical covers automating model management workflows using the [Epsilon Ant tasks](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/workflow/), and using the same Ant tasks to test Epsilon scripts through its [EUnit](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/eunit/) language.

Work through every section of the practical in sequence, without missing steps. You can use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons on the left and right sides to quickly go between sections.
