# Introduction

In this practical you will run the [Epsilon Ant tasks](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/workflow/) to combine an EVL program and an EGL program into a single automated pipeline. You will then add [EUnit](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/eunit/) tests to check that validation and code generation work as intended.

## What you should already know

- How to use EOL to query models.
- How to use EVL to validate models.
- How to use EGX/EGL to transform models to text.

## What you will learn

- How to write and run model management worfklows from Eclipse with Ant.
- How to test Epsilon programs using EUnit.

## What you will need

- An Eclipse installation with EMF and Epsilon (see the [Tools](../modelling-and-metamodelling/tools.md) section of Practical 6).
