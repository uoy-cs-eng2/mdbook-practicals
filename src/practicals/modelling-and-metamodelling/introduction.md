# Introduction

In this practical you will design domain-specific metamodels using [Emfatic](https://eclipse.dev/emfatic). You will also create models conforming to these metamodels, using a reflective tree-based editor and/or [Flexmi](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/flexmi).

## What you should already know

- You must have attended or watched the Eclipse Modelling Framework lecture.

## What you will learn

- How to define domain-specific metamodels using Emfatic.
- How to create models that conform to such domain-specific metamodels.

## What you will need

- An Eclipse installation with EMF and Epsilon (see the [Tools](tools.md) section of this practical).
