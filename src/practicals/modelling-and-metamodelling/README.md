# Practical 6: Metamodelling and modelling

<!--TODO: Follow a consistent structure with intro like ../intro-micronaut/01-introduction.md and additional exercises like in ../intro-micronaut/07-additional-exercises.md -->

- For this practical you need to design a few domain-specific metamodels using [Emfatic](https://eclipse.dev/emfatic)
    - You also need to design models conforming to these metamodels, using the reflective tree-based editor and/or [Flexmi](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/flexmi)
- You **must** have watched the Eclipse Modelling Framework lecture before you attempt this practical
