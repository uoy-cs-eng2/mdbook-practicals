# Practical 6: Metamodelling and modelling

This is the worksheet for the sixth practical in the Engineering 2 module.

In this practical you will define domain-specific metamodels and models that conform to them. You will use these metamodels and models in the remaining practicals of the module.

Work through every section of the practical in sequence, without missing steps. You can use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons on the left and right sides to quickly go between sections.
